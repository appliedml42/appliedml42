I have been using Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing to bring value to organizations like Amazon and Tinder since 2011. Andrew Ng's lecture at Amazon introduced me to Deep Learning in the early 2010s. I have been hooked ever since.

## Machine Learning Engineer, Trust&Safety@Tinder

+ Lead a team of Machine Learning Engineers(dotted line reporting) that is responsible for significant Trust and Safety KPIs. Responsible for hiring, mentoring, and team charter.
+ Pioneered the idea of using human moderation logs to generate weakly labeled training data at Tinder.
+ Led the teamâ€™s adoption of CNNs and Transformers for all text classification projects. Significant contributions include setting up from-scratch pre-training patterns for Transformers, Domain-specific tokenization, and text pre-processing algorithms to handle adversarial behavior.
+ Created and led (dotted line) the Escalation and Early Warning team. This team of analysts is responsible for tracking global Trust and Safety KPIs and continuously optimizing detection strategies. Invented KPIs that Trust and Safety org adopted to measure OKRs. This team also provides continuous       feedback to MLEs on new trends and keeps them updated on where to focus while improving their models.
+ Invented many high ROI and robust non-ML detection algorithms. Significantly ones include combining user reporting with early-in-the-funnel signals to catch bad actors robustly and anomaly detection in user-generated text content.

## Applied Scientist, Search Experience@Amazon

+ Technical Lead for a team of 6 Applied Scientists working on query understanding.
+ Led the R&D and deployment of Search Experience's first query -> category Deep Learning model. This was a Recurrent Neural Network text classification model trained on months of search logs. This model became the foundation for many other products in the team that needed an understanding of query categories.
+ Pioneered GPU-enabled development, training, inference practices, and infrastructure for Deep Learning in the team. This infrastructure is based on AWS Batch and Docker.

## Software Engineer, Kindle@Amazon
  
+ Founding engineer on the X-Ray team. This feature identifies topics, characters, images, and important sections of a book. This information is presented to the user in a intuitive user interface. This feature is part of the Amazon Kindle reading experience.
+ Developed algorithms to associate the different aliases used for a character to a single entity. For example, the algorithm will ensure that Mr. Potter and Harry Potter are associated with the same character.
+ Generated n-gram count statistics across the whole Kindle catalog using Map-Reduce and Dynamo DB. This data is used for topic modeling. 
+ Developed the algorithms for identifying critical passages in a book by crowd-sourcing highlight behavior across all Kindle users.
